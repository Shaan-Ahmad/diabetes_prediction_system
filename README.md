# Diabetes Prediction System

## Introduction

This project is a Diabetes Prediction System built using machine learning. It helps predict whether a person is diabetic based on medical input features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc

## Overview

The model is trained using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and deployed using Streamlit for an interactive web application. Users can input their medical data through a web form and get an instant prediction

## Functions

- **Model Training:** The model is trained in Google Colab using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm
- **Prediction System:** A Python script loads the trained model and predicts diabetes based on user input
- **Web App:** A simple Streamlit web interface allows users to enter details and view the prediction result
